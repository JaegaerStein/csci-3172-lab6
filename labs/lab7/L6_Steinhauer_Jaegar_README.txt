This lab involves developing and deploying a React application using Bootstrap for styling. The main objective is to ensure proper component structure, routing, and UI design, while also testing the application for expected behavior.

Testing: 
App Component: Verified that the home page renders by default and that a 404 page appears for unknown routes.
Home Page: Checked for the correct rendering of the welcome message and introductory text.
NotFound Page: Ensured the 404 error message is displayed along with a functional link to return to the home page.
These tests were conducted using Jest and React Testing Library. The MemoryRouter was used to simulate navigation behavior without requiring a full browser environment. The tests confirmed that all expected elements were rendered correctly.

## Built With

<!--- Provide a list of the frameworks used to build this application, your list should include the name of the framework used, the url where the framework is available for download and what the framework was used for, see the example below --->

* [Dropwizard](http://www.dropwizard.io/1.0.2/docs/) - The web framework used
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) - Dependency Management
* [ROME](https://rometools.github.io/rome/) - Used to generate RSS Feeds

I used bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css for automated styling, I plan to personalize this site more in the next two labs assignment.

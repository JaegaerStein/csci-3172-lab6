``` I need to make my webpage responsive to different page sizes and/or devices, can you add this functionality to this style.css file: (copy of style.css) 


body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    line-height: 1.6; 
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;

The code prompt above was used [NAME](link) to generate the code shown below: 

@media (max-width: 768px) {
    body {
        font-size: 14px;
    }

    header h1 {
        font-size: 2em;
    }

    main {
        padding: 15px;
    }
}

```

@media (max-width: 768px) {
    body {
        font-size: 14px;
    }

    header h1 {
        font-size: 2em;
    }

    main {
        padding: 15px;

    }

    main {
        padding: 15px;
    }
}
/* display for phone screen, not generated by AI but still cited as I reused the code */
@media (max-width: 500px) {
    body {
        font-size: 10px;
    }

    header h1 {
        font-size: 2em;
    }

    main {

- <!---How---> The code in ChatGPT(http://www.chatgpt.com) was implemented by copying the @media section and adding it in the style.css file. This code worked and I played with the font sizes and padding, but deciding on keeping what it gave me as I liked the way it looked.
 
- <!---Why---> ChatGPT(http://www.chatgpt.com)'s Code was used because I didn't know how to make responsive elements in the webpage, and I didn't know what pixel width to use as a limiter for these responsive changes. 

- <!---How---> ChatGPT(http://www.chatgpt.com)'s Code was modified by adding an additional @media function (lines 98-110) which reduced the font size again to account for even narrower screens/devices.

Logic behind using Maps:
I used maps to the username-password key pairs. Maps allow for fast lookup, and made the most sense for this lab as we only needed to store 2 associative values. I also "localStorage" to carry over the registration information to the login page, as I could not make the script file work while handling both pages in one file, so the scripts had to be made seperate.

Question Answers:
(a) Scope of a const variable: Block scope (limited to the block in which it is defined).
(b) When were let and const added to JavaScript? ES6 (2015).
(c) If you change let for var in your script(s), would it still work? Yes, but the block-scoping would change, potentially leading to bugs in larger codebases.

I would like to mention that I had already submitted the wrong version of this lab which costed me multiple hours of work. 
Please try to not put out the wrong instructions again.
